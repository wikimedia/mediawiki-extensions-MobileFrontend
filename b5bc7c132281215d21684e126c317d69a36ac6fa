      "message": "This is a big improvement but I think it is a little unfortunate that this API cannot return a Promise instead. We could hold the promise and dot off Promise.all() where needed. This would allow us to connect to the model manager early. I have no idea what connecting to a model manager does but maybe it has to do some work and either way it would be nice to group the similar Echo integration calls.",
