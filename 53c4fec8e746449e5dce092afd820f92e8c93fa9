However, this function as it\u0027s own doesn\u0027t seem to be \"mobile-specific\", that\u0027s what I wanted to say :)",

      "message": "Given the time it takes patches to be merged into core, can I suggest putting a TODO here? Would that work for now? Also, I think there maybe many other useful pieces of code that is used in MF only. By your logic should we be upstreaming that too? The rule of thumb I follow is to have at least two use cases in different extensions.",
