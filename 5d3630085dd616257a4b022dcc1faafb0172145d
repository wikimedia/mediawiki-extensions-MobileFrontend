This also wouldn\u0027t fix the FOUC problem with tablets as they would be collapsed by default due to a lack of the open-block class.\n\nJS is needed to detect that we are in tablet mode.\nJS adds an open-block class to the collapsible block.\n\nThe FOUC content is thus caused by tablets not having the open-block class and not knowing whether it will be added. Using the [onclick] attribute allows us to detect this interim state.",

The proposed code will work exactly as before on small screen devices.\n\n\u003e This also wouldn\u0027t fix the FOUC problem with tablets as they would be collapsed by default due to a lack of the open-block class.\nYes it does. Since we\u0027re limiting the scope of the rule to small screen devices, tablets won\u0027t have collapsed sections by default.\n\nBut, as you say, more work is needed to make collapsing working on tablets once the toggling code has loaded. I have a sneak suspicion that it can be done with CSS only.",
