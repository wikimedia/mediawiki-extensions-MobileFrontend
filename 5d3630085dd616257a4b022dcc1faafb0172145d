      "message": "That will break section collapsing on mobile (it would expand all the sections on mobile and it would not be possible to close them). This also wouldn\u0027t fix the FOUC problem with tablets as they would be collapsed by default due to a lack of the open-block class.\n\nJS is needed to detect that we are in tablet mode.\nJS adds an open-block class to the collapsible block.\n\nThe FOUC content is thus caused by tablets not having the open-block class and not knowing whether it will be added. Using the [onclick] attribute allows us to detect this interim state.",
