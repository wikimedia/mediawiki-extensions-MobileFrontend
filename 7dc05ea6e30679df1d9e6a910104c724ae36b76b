      "message": "Honestly, I think it\u0027s a premature optimization at this point. Total weight of a small page on mobile (infobox, one image) is a bit over 100KB [1], big pages (featured articles, popular articles) can be 300KB to over 1MB [2][3]. Introducing a new mechanism of loading styles (which is something you have to maintain and keep bug-free) for saving 1.2KB [4] seems a little bit of an overkill. Oh, subtract 254 bytes from 1.2KB because that\u0027s uglified matchMedia.js size ;)\n\n[1] http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brake_Gangwayed\n[2] http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coonskin_(film)\n[3] http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco\n[4] http://127.0.0.1:8080/w/load.php?debug\u003dfalse\u0026lang\u003den\u0026modules\u003dtablet.styles\u0026only\u003dstyles\u0026skin\u003dminerva",
