      "message": "We change from \u0027img, .navbox, .infobox\u0027 to \u0027img, .navbox\u0027. This means we will not show the button e.g. on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87eltik%C3%A7i,_Manavgat\n\nAs MaxSem pointed out in some previous conversations, we should check the size of the image too. We\u0027ll probably want to do that eventually, even if not in this commit.\n\nI\u0027m not sure about moving the CSS selector here (as a PHP variable). If we added checking image size to the algorithm, then having the CSS selector in PHP and the rest of the algorithm (checking image sizes) in JS would make the whole thing really confusing.",

      "message": "In both situations https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87eltik%C3%A7i,_Manavgat will not get a photo upload button. There are too many edge cases but at least with being able to configure the CSS selector we can get smarter.\n\nThe main reason for making this configurable is if people moan about photos being added to pages above an infobox that they need to move we can deal with this by disabling by updating a config variable.",

      "message": "the name of this method is misleading; i would expect it to return all config variables. also, im not sure but is this really the right place to be sending this vars? if so, it would be good to also implement a way to set specific config vars to be sent (create a setter method and maybe store the values in an object property) and add appropriate phpunit tests.",
