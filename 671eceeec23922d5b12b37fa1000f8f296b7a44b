      "message": "I think we can break the dependency, do we need to depend on the PageImages extension in the constructor?\n\nI would make the constructor dumb and always expect both `$title` and the $file, and then, in the code, or always pass the `$title`, and `$file`, or create a builder.\n\nLooks like the MobilePage is created only in one place (SpecialMobileEditWatchlist::executeViewEditWatchlist()), maybe we can move that logic there, and remove the PageImages related logic.\n\nAlso, if you take a closer look, the SpecialMobileEditWatchlist is already handling the page images, most probably there is no need to try to fetch the image here.",
