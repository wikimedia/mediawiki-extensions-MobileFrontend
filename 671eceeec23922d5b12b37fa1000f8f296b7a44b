      "message": "I think we can break the dependency, do we need to depend on the PageImages extension in the constructor?\n\nI would make the constructor dumb and always expect both `$title` and the $file, and then, in the code, or always pass the `$title`, and `$file`, or create a builder.\n\nLooks like the MobilePage is created only in one place (SpecialMobileEditWatchlist::executeViewEditWatchlist()), maybe we can move that logic there, and remove the PageImages related logic.\n\nAlso, if you take a closer look, the SpecialMobileEditWatchlist is already handling the page images, most probably there is no need to try to fetch the image here.",

      "message": "Thanks @Pmiazga, I think there is more to this brilliant idea you\u0027ve shared. More things will need to be changed if this code is moved to SpecialMobileEditWatchlist class, I guess?\n\nAnd to be honest, I\u0027ve not fully understood this idea but I see the line of reasoning, could you, if possible, add a PS on this what you mean, so I can see? The current patch looses the dependency a bit which seems to work fine but yes, please add your idea :) My fear here is not to break things that will harm the codebase in general.",
