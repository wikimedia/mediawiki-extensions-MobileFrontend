      "message": "I believe all of the assertions in the callback depend on the promise resolving first. Previously, TalkOverlay used .done which according to https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#backwards-compatibility can result in sync resolution if the Deferred is already resolved (as it is with the test stub). Therefore, we were able to make the test synchronous. However, .then will always result in async resolution so the test needs to be async to handle that.",
