      "message": "We should actually not hide the counter when it\u0027s zero for two reasons: \n1. The user should be able to see their *read* notification list\n2. The popup re-populates each time you reopen, so the number may change, but if we remove/hide the counter, they can\u0027t reopen/repopulate anymore.\n\nBut this is probably outside the scope of this commit, since it will change the behavior. We should talk about this, though, for followup.",
