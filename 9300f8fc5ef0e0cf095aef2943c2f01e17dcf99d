      "message": "This is an excellent question. :-) The short answer is: don\u0027t worry. As far as PHP is concerned, the \"use\" syntax is nothing but an entry in a string \u003d\u003e string map. For example, \"use Foo\\Bar\" creates an entry \"Bar\" \u003d\u003e \"Foo\\Bar\". The \"use\" alone does not trigger a check if a class with this name exists. Not even \"Bar::class\" needs the class to exist, which is why we can call \"class_exists( Bar::class )\".",
