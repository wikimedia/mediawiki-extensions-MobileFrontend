      "message": "file_get_contents returns false if it fails to read the file, so you can simply omit the file_exists check (which costs you another system call), and simply check if $content \u003d\u003d\u003d false.\n\nI was _going_ to suggest that, but then I noticed that includes/resourceloader/ResourceLoaderFileModule.php in core does it as well, presumably for good reason. I guess it\u0027s because ResourceLoader wants to make sure that only the informative error is outputted rather than also the warning from the failed file_exists_check, but I\u0027m not sure.\n\nI\u0027m writing this comment out of my own curiosity in the hope that Krinkle or Trevor can explain. It\u0027s not something you have to fix or anything.",
