      "message": "Did you consider using a template here.\n\nIt\u0027s my understanding that removing templatePartials is a good thing, as a templatePartial is basically a component in a disguise, but there\u0027s nothing wrong with templates in general IMO.\n\nThe danger of this is if text contains html (which is possible with messages) these could render as HTML. It must be escaped (Hogan was doing that for you but now you must do it)",

      "message": "This still uses a template just not a Mustache template. I think this approach is simpler. I\u0027m especially interested in an approach like Viewless demo[0] which is similar to Popups and uses (or will use) mw.html.escape(). Do you disagree?\n\nWe can still use the Hogan flavored template if you think it\u0027s worthwhile. It would fit in this patch easily enough but I don\u0027t think it helps our goals in the short or the long term.\n\nI\u0027m very interested to discuss short term component composition more and have added a bullet to the next super-happy-dev-time.\n\n[0] https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/mediawiki/extensions/MobileFrontend/+/498196/",
