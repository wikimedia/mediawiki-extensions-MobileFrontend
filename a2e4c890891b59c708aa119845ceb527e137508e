      "message": "This code here made me wonder. As far as I can see, this class uses three elements from the provided $config object. The first one is stored in a class property here in this line. Another one is passed to the LazyImageTransform constructor below. The last one is the \"MFRemovableClasses\" property, used a single time in the code below. For this property alone the entire Config object was stored.\n\nI changed this in patch set 6 and introduced a dedicated class property.",
