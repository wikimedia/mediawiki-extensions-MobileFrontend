      "message": "This makes sense to me and definitely seems to be a pattern that\u0027s leaking into our codebase, so it makes sense to formalise it.\n\nHowever, it also feels a shame to make these separate options, as in future we might want to make use of Object spreading\ne.g.\n{ api, isAnon, title  }\nThis would also be compatible with Preact/React, if we ever decided to make our components more React-compatible.\n\nI\u0027d personally like us to work towards adopting React style function/variable names e.g. props instead of options and getting View.render to return something HTML like.\n\nAlso, changing function signatures is hard and time consuming because of our needs to support multiple-cached versions (see my notes on Minerva: https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/460548 )",
