      "message": "Long term we should only be defining and documenting our public API e.g. what is used by other extensions/skins.\n\nKnowing time is used in Minerva is really useful.\n\nEventually a lot of these defines will no longer be necessary so I like that the resource-modules flags this warning and tells us we\u0027ve successfully ported time and its users inside MobileFrontend to webpack\n\nPer my notes on https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/mediawiki/skins/MinervaNeue/+/463786/ I don\u0027t think we should remove this.\n\nI understand the issue and I\u0027ll look at resource-modules to see what can be changed here to stop this breaking.\n\nIt\u0027s becoming clear we need to invest some time into the resource-modules library.",
