      "message": "This is... OK but feels hackish. Since everything else in wgMFConfigProperties gets handled in extMobileFrontend (and minifyJS no longer will since it is now no longer a property), this is inconsistent and will potentially bite a new mobile developer in the ass. I think it would be better to leave minifyJS as an object property of extMobileFrontend and access it the same way you do below with isBetaGroupMember",

I think this would be a lot easier to follow, plus making changes in the future would likely be easier.",
