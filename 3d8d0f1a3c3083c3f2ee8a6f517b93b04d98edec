Something feels wrong.\n\nIt is not widely supported on the older devices like Android 2 [1] (not sure whether we still care about it) and I suspect is not so performant. What other choices do we have?\n\nAlso it\u0027s not clear to me why header-loaded still works but the history-link-loaded event fires. Can you clarify that in the commit message?\n\n[1] http://caniuse.com/#feat\u003dcss-sel3",
