      "message": "Every time you change stable code in a change for beta/alpha a kitten dies.. can we make this a little less brittle? I seem to remember asking way back\n\nThese rules are also going to apply in stable if we ever use header-icon class there...\n\nWhy don\u0027t you just add a generic class to #mw-mf-main-menu-button now and simplify this selector into one class along with #mw-mf-main-menu-button for caching purposes?\n\n\nI mean we already have main-header-button class in stable.... can\u0027t we just reuse that?",

      "message": "I agree that I should not have made those classes affect stable. However, this code has been around for a while and it\u0027s been working. Do you think the best course of action is to add the .alpha/.beta classes here and create a new task about simplifying those classes? Also, as you can see in alpha the header is a little different. We need to track two different item clicks. We can use the main-header-button icon for sure, but we still need to create another class for the .header-title link.",

      "message": "From my perspective, beta code should be as close to shippable as possible. I agree it should be done in a separate patch but should probably be done before doing this to make it easier to revert if needed.\n\n\"working\" is one thing but code quality is another.\nThere is no rush to get this feature out, so why not take some time to better the code?\n\nThey all seem to have one thing in common here in that they open the main menu, so there should be an easy way to locate these buttons [role\u003dmainmenu] or .main-menu-button\n\nWe\u0027re using an id selector here already which seems ill-thought out since it assumes we will always access a main menu.\n\nThat\u0027s my 2 cents anyway.\nNot knowing this code well though it would be better to get feedback from someone who understands its idiosyncrasies",
