      "message": "Initialising a class after setting its prototype is not supported. It may or may not work right now, but is unsupported. The order is: constructor, init, inheritance, mixin, other methods.\n\nRe-arranging the last two points so that you can assign prototype cleanly and do mixin later is fine, but that means you can\u0027t do inheritance. However at the very least initClass must remain before the prototype assignment to ensure consistency.",
