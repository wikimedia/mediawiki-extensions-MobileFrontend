      "message": "So, there are two \"displayTitle\" fields used in the templates, and one is already HTML, and the other needs escaping? That sounds like asking for trouble, one of them should be renamed.\n\nAnyway - if you are positive that this is always being escaped on output, then it shouldn\u0027t be escaped here. I don\u0027t understand the details of hoe output is generated by MF. I just looked for \"displayTitle\", and assumed it would always refer to the same thing, which is HTML per definition.",
