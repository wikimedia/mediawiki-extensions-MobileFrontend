I made it quoted as it is also quoted in the core (desktop) code: https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki/blob/6e9b4f0e9ce4ccd6089c18b205065ef7fa077484/includes/specialpage/ChangesListSpecialPage.php#L260\nI have of course noticed that RC_EXTERNAL is not quoted but I have thought it should not get quoted (if ever) in this particular change.\nI would consider it good to quote RC_EXTERNAL too, or is there any need not to do that? I\u0027ll make a change quoting RC_EXTERNAL and it can be further discussed there.",
