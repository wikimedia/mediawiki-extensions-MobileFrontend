He explains the rational on the task detail of T74063\n\nNamely:\n* chromium is faster\n* PhantomJS is based on a totally outdated engine (some old Safari engine). As a result code ends up falling mysteriously.\n\n\nOur Trusty slaves have a permanent XVFB on display port 94. That is used by Qunit jobs.
