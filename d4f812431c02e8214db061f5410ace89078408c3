      "message": "I would say that\u0027s more hacky, what with the two different hook registration mechanisms and the circumvention of the machine-readable hook registry. SpecialMobileDiff could set some global flag and it could be read here, that would be functionally equivalent to dynamic registration and less hacky; but using the context does not seem particularly bad to me, when it\u0027s even provided by the hook.",
