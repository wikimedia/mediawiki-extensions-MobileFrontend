      "message": "We don\u0027t seem to have any strict code convention around this that I could find looking quickly through the style guide for MW, but looking quickly through the code, this can be confusing. I recommend switching this to $recentChangesView \u003d ( $view \u003d\u003d \u0027feed\u0027 ), or with a more explicit ternary, $recentChangesView \u003d ( $view \u003d\u003d \u0027feed\u0027 ) ? true : false. Otherwise it looks confusingly like assignment. Readability is everything!\n\nAlso, I think that \u003d\u003d\u003d is generally preferable to \u003d\u003d unless you need the flexibility of \u003d\u003d.",
