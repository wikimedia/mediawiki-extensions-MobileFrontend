      "message": "I must reveal my ignorance but the functions that are produced here don\u0027t seem so unique. Did you consider creating a \"requester\" that just needs a gateway and a Thumbnail to issue a given request? It feels strange to me that we would need to persist more than a Thumbnail[]. Maybe something like \n\n function request(gateway, thumbnail) {\n   return gateway.getThumb( thumbnail.getFileName() ).then( function ( data ) {\n     // ...\n   } )\n }\n\nI don\u0027t understand why the function needs to be passed around but maybe those closures could be isolated:\n\n {thumbnail, request: () \u003d\u003e request(gateway, this.thumbnail)}",

Did you consider just \"filename\"?\n\nAlso, what do you think about return an object like {filename: string; request(): Deferred\u003cImageObject\u003e}? Although the effect is the same, I think adding properties to plain old objects reads easier than adding props to functions. What do you think?",
