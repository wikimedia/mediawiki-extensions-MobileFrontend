      "message": "Not necessarily a blocker but do you know why these files differ? When I compare debug builds of mediawiki.template.hogan.js before and after this change, they do not. Is this an issue with our uglification? I would like to avoid unknown changes to our build products if only so we\u0027re better prepared for code-splitting and caching discussions later.",

      "message": "What were your thoughts on picking a singleton pattern? I have no qualms with making a single instance of something but obviously we wish to avoid globals.\n\nI was thinking this could be a parameter passed in which would let us move the singleton to mobile.startup.js and eliminate its usage as a global. However, I guess we\u0027d have to do some big refactoring as soon as we move the code to source and drop the IIFE which would be a task in itself.\n\nI was just hoping to hear your insights on the approach taken. The commit message talks about injecting the dependency which I normally associate with passing from the point of instantiation to every consumer. This seems like a hybrid approach where we pass the dependency when it\u0027s practical to do so and use the global otherwise.",
