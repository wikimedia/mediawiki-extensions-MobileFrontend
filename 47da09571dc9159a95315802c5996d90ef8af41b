      "message": "Indenting this for other reviewers for readability. The trick that\u0027s used\nhere is to use the arbitrary plural form 0 for anonymous users, to avoid\nhaving to special case the anonymous user in separate messages.\n\n [$4 Last {{GENDER:$1|edited}} {{PLURAL:$3|$3 second|$3 seconds}} ago] {{PLURAL:$5|\n  by [$6 $2]|\n  0\u003dby an anonymous user\n }}\n\nTo save a few characters, \"by \" can be taken outside of the PLURAL:$5.\n\nI think this is a very creative use of PLURAL, basically (ab)using it as\na switch. I identified this type of abuse a while after we implemented\nthis flexibility, but this is the first real-world use. It should be fine\nto use it, but we have to be aware that this can confuse translators, and\nmake the strings a lot more complex. Use with care!",
