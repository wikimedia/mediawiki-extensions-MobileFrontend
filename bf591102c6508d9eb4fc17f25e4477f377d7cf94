      "message": "Is it worth doing that? What you really want to do at the only usage (count( $mobilePages ) \u003d\u003d\u003d 0 in SpecialMobileEditWatchlist) is that you need to know, if there are pages in or not. You don\u0027t need the size of the pages array. So I would suggest to implement an \"isEmpty()\" method, instead of implementing Countable (however, implementing Countable could be useful later). The isEmpty method could then just return empty( $pages );. This would avoid the overhead of counting the elements of pages when you really don\u0027t need to.",
