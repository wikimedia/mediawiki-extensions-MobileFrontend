      "message": "This overwrites a long-lifetime variable (sampleRate) based on a short-lifetime per-call value (data.editor_interface). That bothers me, and I think it could cause issues like the oversampling surviving an editor switch when it shouldn\u0027t.\n\nIt also completely breaks the is_oversample logic on line 116, which will always return false (except the first time).",
