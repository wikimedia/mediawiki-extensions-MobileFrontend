      "message": "Note if for whatever reason title is something other than a string this will also cause issues. \n\nI\u0027d be keen for us to assert it is a string since there is nothing stopping an editor from doing:\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\"talk\" data-title\u003d\"{}\"\u003etext\u003c/div\u003e\nand also make sure we use an id selector the talk link to avoid any other weirdness - this issue might be related to people using the talk class for other things.\n\nAlso the logic here at this point probably warrants to be inside an if block rather than this very long statement.",

      "message": "You may want to avoid .data() in that case and access .attr(\u0027data-title\u0027) plain. It will always be a string. JSON objects don\u0027t exist in HTML. Any attempt from jQuery to return something as JSON will be unexpected behaviour. For example, if the data attribute is for the page \"true\" or \"2015\" you want strings as well, so you really don\u0027t want .data(). And not to mention page \"false\" or \"0\".",
