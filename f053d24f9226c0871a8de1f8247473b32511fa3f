      "message": "I couldn\u0027t find in Webpack and Babel docs.. but, what are the default transform plugins? es6/2015? latest? \n\nWe may want to make the version/transforms used explicit if there\u0027s a default, so as to only expand it when intentionally so, with an understanding of its impact (e.g. what the code really becomes in production, and whether there\u0027s any caveats or inefficiencies to avoid).\n\nIn the docs I noticed the \"loose\" option, which seems like it might make the output more natural and smaller. What\u0027s your experience been with that? Is it any good?",

      "message": "The distinction is quite small, but I think this should be based on the interpretation of the feature test, not the browser support matrix.\n\nhttps://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki/blob/ea7736c615b56270e888137af7b005e2157a0953/resources/src/startup/startup.js\n\nSpecifically, if a browser passes our feature test, we must not trigger a fatal error as that would not allow graceful recovery to Grade C.\n\nAs such, decisions based on using features and syntax, must be guarded by a feature test, or match as precisely as possible, the result of the default feature-test in core.\n\nNotable differences:\n\n safari: 5.0,\n ios: 6.0,\n firefox: 4.0,\n chrome: 13.0\n\nGiven ios 6.x as the likely lowest common denominator, this probably won\u0027t make any difference in the output, though, but will help ensure mistakes in the future.",
