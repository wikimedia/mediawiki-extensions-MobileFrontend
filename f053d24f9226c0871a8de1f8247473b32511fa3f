      "message": "The distinction is quite small, but I think this should be based on the interpretation of the feature test, not the browser support matrix.\n\nhttps://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki/blob/ea7736c615b56270e888137af7b005e2157a0953/resources/src/startup/startup.js\n\nSpecifically, if a browser passes our feature test, we must not trigger a fatal error as that would not allow graceful recovery to Grade C.\n\nAs such, decisions based on using features and syntax, must be guarded by a feature test, or match as precisely as possible, the result of the default feature-test in core.\n\nNotable differences:\n\n safari: 5.0,\n ios: 6.0,\n firefox: 4.0,\n chrome: 13.0\n\nGiven ios 6.x as the likely lowest common denominator, this probably won\u0027t make any difference in the output, though, but will help ensure mistakes in the future.",
