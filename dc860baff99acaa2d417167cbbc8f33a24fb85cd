      "message": "It\u0027s only used in combination with CentralAuth, which is, in fact, mostly used in WMF wikis as far as I know. But, this function indicates, that it works for both, an installation with a different mobile url and an installation without a different mobile url, which is a false positive. If there isn\u0027t a mobile url template (both, desktop and mobile has the same url, e.g. mostly used in third party wikis), this will return always true.\n\nThat\u0027s not a problem, as long as this function is only used in CentralAuth, but i suspect, that, if a function exists in MobileFrontend, it is possible, that it is used in other places, too. So I suggest to at least add a comment, that this function only works, if $wgMobileUrlTemplate is set, or implement a check for it in some way :)",
