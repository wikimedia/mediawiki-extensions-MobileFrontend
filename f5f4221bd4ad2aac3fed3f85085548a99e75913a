      "message": "Yes we can. QUnit provide `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks at the module level, which run before and after each test in a module. \n\n\nThese hooks have to be called on a per-module basis https://www.sitepoint.com/qunit-advanced-concepts-modules-configuration/ which could be a little tedious, and isn\u0027t necessary in a browser context. \n\n\nAn option could be to use nested modules, and define these hooks on the parent module, because I think the parent hooks still get called on child modules. We would still have to call these hooks conditionally only for Node though. \n\n\nAnother option would be to override the `QUnit.module` function to included these hooks on each module. This is what Joaquin did here https://github.com/wikimedia/mw-node-qunit/blob/master/wikimedia-setup.js and I think the benefit of that is that it would only be run in Node (since I believe the config file is only run in Node mode).",
