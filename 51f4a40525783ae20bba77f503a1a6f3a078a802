      "message": "I thought the reason why this was here was because we wanted to replace the placeholders by actual references. If that\u0027s not the case I don\u0027t see why this should still be here. Upon closer examination, I see that the HTMLScraper version of the gateway doesn\u0027t need the page object either. It just needs a jQuery selector that selects page references. Could we change that implementation so that we don\u0027t have to create a page object in the first place? We\u0027ll just use $refSections to find what we\u0027re looking for.",
