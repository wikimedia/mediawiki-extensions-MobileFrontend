      "message": "Repeating question from earlier patchset..\nThe problem is mw-empty-elt seem to have non-zero length empty strings\n\nstring-length(text()) \u003e 0 is true  for https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title\u003dFrance as it has 3 new line characters.\n\nIs there a way to check the trimmed string-length? I think this would simplify the code a lot as we don\u0027t need to worry about mw-empty-elt Looks like normalize-space exists.\n\nPut simply: Can we can avoid the check of the mw-empty-elt class altogether?",
