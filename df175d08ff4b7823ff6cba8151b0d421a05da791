It sounds to me like \"Anonymous users cannot edit, but this user might be logged in\" rather than \"Anonymous users cannot edit, but logged in users might be able to edit\". Rather than renaming it $anonUsersCannotEditButLoggedInUsersMightBeAbleToEdit, let\u0027s rename it to just $anonUsersCannotEdit and explain the logic for why we are checking this in a comment (rather than as part of the variable name).",
