      "message": "This reintroduces a problem, which was fixed in: I4750412c943d89f37b7ad5e21df4e321191bf772\n\nTalkOverlay has a change between several Overlays (talk overview, discussion view and add view). So it should be configurable (e.g. a variable here in Overlay.js \"hasAnimations\" or something else) to control, if the Overlay has an animation when it starts/ends. With this we could control, that (in routes like Talk) only the first overlay has an animation.",
