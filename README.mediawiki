= MobileFrontend Extension =
The MobileFrontend extension adds a mobile view to your mediawiki
instance.

== Installation ==
See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:MobileFrontend#Installation

== Configuration ==
See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:MobileFrontend#Configuration_settings

== Development ==

=== Coding conventions ===
Please follow the coding conventions of MobileFrontend:
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MobileFrontend/Coding_conventions

==== Git hooks ====
Git hooks are provided in the dev-scripts directory to assist with adhering to JavaScript
code standards, optimizing PNG files, etc. Running these hooks requires node.js, NPM, and
grunt.

Install like so:
  make installhooks

If you are not running Vagrant, be sure to set your MEDIAWIKI_URL env variable to your
local index path, e.g. 'MEDIAWIKI_URL=http://localhost/index.php/'

=== Committing ===
Commits are important as they give the reviewer more information to
successfully review your code and find errors or potential problems you
might not have thought of.

Commits are also useful when troubleshooting issues and refactoring.  If
it's not clear why a line of code is in the repository important bug
fixes could be lost.

Commits should be as minor as possible. Please avoid removing unrelated
console.log statements, fixing unrelated whitespace etc.  do that in a
separate commit which mentions the word cleanup.

First line commit should summarise the commit with bug it fixes if
applicable. e.g. Fix problem with toggling see bug x. Second line should
be blank. Third line should go into detail where necessary providing
links to blog posts/other bugs to provide more background. Mention the
platforms/browsers the change is for where necessary, e.g.:

* 'this is a problem on Android but not OSX see http://<url> which explains problem in detail'
* 'this is a workaround for a known bug in opera mobile see http://<url>'

=== Testing ===

==== Unit tests ====
To run the full test suite run:

  make tests

To run only PHP tests:

  make phpunit

To run only JS tests:

  make qunit

==== Selenium tests ====

For information on how to run Selenium tests please see README file in
tests/browser directory.

=== Releasing ===
A new version of MobileFrontend is released every two weeks. A developer needs to generate
release notes and create a file with the title "RELEASE-NOTES-X.X.X.mediawiki" where "X.X.X"
is the software version. Once a new release is due, the contents of the above file is moved to
HISTORY.mediawiki and the file itself is deleted.
Ideally, we need to create a bot similar to https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Jouncebot that
reads a calendar and pings a developer on #wikimedia-mobile to remind them about a release.

====Generating release notes====
You can generate release notes by running (replace `{ branch name / commit SHA}`):
```make releasenotes from={branch name / commit SHA } to={branch name / commit SHA }```
Which will output a list of commits between two branches or commit SHAs.

====Versioning====
Adhere to http://semver.org/ when changing versions.
<blockquote>
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
    MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
    MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
    PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
</blockquote>
