=== Coding conventions ==
Please follow the coding conventions of MobileFrontend:
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MobileFrontend/Coding_conventions

==== Git hooks ====
Git hooks are provided in the scripts directory to assist with adhering
to JavaScript code standards, optimizing PNG files, etc. Install like
so:

  make installhooks

=== Committing ===
Commits are important as they give the reviewer more information to
successfully review your code and find errors or potential problems you
might not have thought of.

Commits are also useful when troubleshooting issues and refactoring.  If
it's not clear why a line of code is in the repository important bug
fixes could be lost.

Commits should be as minor as possible. Please avoid removing unrelated
console.log statements, fixing unrelated whitespace etc.  do that in a
separate commit which mentions the word cleanup.

First line commit should summarise the commit with bug it fixes if
applicable. e.g. Fix problem with toggling see bug x. Second line should
be blank. Third line should go into detail where necessary providing
links to blog posts/other bugs to provide more background. Mention the
platforms/browsers the change is for where necessary, e.g.:

* 'this is a problem on Android but not OSX see http://<url> which explains problem in detail'
* 'this is a workaround for a known bug in opera mobile see http://<url>'

=== Testing ===

==== Unit tests ====
To run the full test suite run:

  make tests

To run only PHP tests:

  make phpunit

To run only JS tests:

  make qunit

==== Selenium tests ====
To run the Selenium tests you will have to install Ruby (for the exact
version see tests/acceptance/.ruby-version), the latest versions of
RubyGems and Firefox.

The easiest way to install Ruby on *nix is RVM (https://rvm.io/) and on
Windows RubyInstaller (http://rubyinstaller.org/).

Open terminal in tests/acceptance. Update RubyGems and install required
gems with:

  gem update --system
  gem install bundler
  bundle install

You will need to create a user account on your local wiki
See https://github.com/wikimedia/qa-browsertests/blob/master/README.md
for details

Run the tests with:

  bundle exec rake

HTML report is created at tests/acceptance/reports and XML report (for
Jenkins) is created at tests/acceptance/reports/junit.

Jenkins is hosted at https://wmf.ci.cloudbees.com/ and it drives
browsers at http://saucelabs.com/
