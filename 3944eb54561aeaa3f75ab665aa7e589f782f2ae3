      "message": "The constructor of this class establishes 2 db connections and calls the parser 4x to transform interface messages, and the Pager-related parent classes do more things I haven\u0027t looked into.\n\nSeems odd to construct a pager unless you also use its result. I suppose that could work, even without a subclass, using it more like a data provider, in favour of the current custom-made DB queries hardcoded in the class which require maintenance.\n\nThat\u0027s a larger change of course, but not as large as a sub class given it\u0027d allow you to keep the output logic as-is.\n\nAnyway, I\u0027m not really suggesting that, but the alternative would imho be to not construct ContribsPager, e.g. to make it a static method, or to help make its constructor cheaper.",
