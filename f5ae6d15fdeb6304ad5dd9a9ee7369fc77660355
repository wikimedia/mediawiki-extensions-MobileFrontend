      "message": "This config option (MFDefaultSkinClass) is supposed to allow a 3rd party to change the skin from Minerva and to make it easier for us to port Minerva out of MobileFrontend.\n\nIt was a requested feature at one of the hackathons.\n\nFor example:\n\n$wgVectorResponsive \u003d true;\n$wgMFDefaultSkinClass \u003d \u0027SkinVector\u0027;\n\nJust remove the references to beta and you\u0027ll be fine.\nProbably worth dropping a note while you are here in the docs to make clearer why this method is important.",
