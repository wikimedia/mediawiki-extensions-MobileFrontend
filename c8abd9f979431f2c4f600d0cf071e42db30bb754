      "message": "Same for this thing. Why not name it $mobileContext?\n\nSingletons are very bad - they are global state in disguise. Putting them in constructors is especially bad, since now you can no longer construct this object without having it invoke the singleton and all the instantiation and other work that happens there. That means the code is basically impossible to test in isolation as you cannot mock out the thing being pulled in via the singleton.",
