By requiring in config.js, it would not be included in that bundle. \n\nHaving said that, I agree that requiring it as needed in the test file is better and if we can do that and not have webpack include it in the test bundle,  I think that is ideal.",

I would prefer to explicitly configure each test\u0027s set up per test as wanted so that there\u0027s no mystery about what\u0027s attached to the context and each test configures and uses only what it needs. If that\u0027s too verbose, let\u0027s chat about it but I wouldn\u0027t want to assume that we need any infrastructure.\n\nhttps://sinonjs.org/releases/v1.17.7/sandbox/",
