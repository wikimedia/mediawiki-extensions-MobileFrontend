      "message": "Good debugging. As I understand it, this was an issue because an image won\u0027t kick off the download when it\u0027s in a separate document (which means the load / error callback never runs and images are forever lazy). This seems like an unusual case but if you haven\u0027t already, please check the other usages of `\u0027(util|this).parseHTML\u0027`, particularly in View and subclasses, to make sure we didn\u0027t introduce a regression (it looks ok to me).",
