      "message": "\u0027visualEditor\u0027 just looks weird. Since it\u0027s the title of something I think it should always begin with a capital. I suppose we could use \u0027visual\u0027 and \u0027source\u0027 / \u0027wikitext\u0027 instead?\n\nI wondered about enum but it always seems like a lot of hassle when we want to tweak things. I wondered if we might want to distinguish between SourceEditor, VisualEditor and SourceEditor (when VisualEditor is available) so I left this open.\n\nHappy to change to an enum if you think this is significant.",
