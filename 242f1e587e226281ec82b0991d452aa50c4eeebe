      "message": "I\u0027m currently working towards removing the show function altogether, so I\u0027d rather we didn\u0027t add this here as this makes my life a lot more complicated and it will likely break again.\n\nThe idea with View\u0027s is that they can be re-rendered by calling render again. These events will thus get lost if that ever happens. What is the problem with adding this inside postRender?\n\nAlso I can\u0027t help but notice that most of this code doesn\u0027t seem very Overlay specific. I\u0027m wondering if it could live in its own file and be applied to the overlay itself. Can we separate the concerns of rendering an overlay from making it scroll correctly (maybe applying these scroll hacks inside the overlayManager?",

      "message": "I agree that this function should not exist, and this functionality should be in OverlayManager. But currently it exists and is here, and I made an effort to keep my changes focussed instead of rewriting everything.\n\nI did this exactly because it seems that y\u0027all are in the process of rewriting everything I touch and I wanted to avoid major functional conflicts amd wasted work this time.\n\nI don\u0027t understand your comment about \u0027render\u0027. My changes do not touch the render function, and these events actually will not be lost if it is called twice or more, as they are attached to the global Window object.",
