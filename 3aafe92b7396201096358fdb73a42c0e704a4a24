      "message": "I think numbers are bad because they don\u0027t tell much by themselves. This, on the contrary, is self-descriptive. Also, the soon-to-be-implemented language overlay is a little more advanced than this and can be named \u0027structured-overlay\u0027 as the task suggests. Having said that, I think we can discuss the merits of each approach or which word to use endlessly. Thus I suggest we go with this solution. After all the person who\u0027s analysing the language overlay needs to be able to do so easily and without referring to numbers.",
