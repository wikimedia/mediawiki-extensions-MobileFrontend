      "message": "It\u0027s an internal thing and not meant for public consumption. If you scan the rest of the code it is used by not only _showOverlay but _hideOverlay and attached in _processMatch. Naming it something similar would just cause confusion and it\u0027s purpose should be clear when you view the tests and rest of code.\n\nMy only criteria here is to use a name that is unlikely to be used by anything else and to avoid Overlays having to know about the existence of the manager.",
