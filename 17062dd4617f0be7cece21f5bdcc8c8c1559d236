If we need to expose this value more frequently, we should think about ways to cache this - and I\u0027m guessing that caching should occur on the frontend rather than the backend (eg do this one, store the value in LocalStorage, and update when an image is uploaded via mobile) or alternatively, to do it with memcache on the backend (and similarly update when an image gets uploaded).",
