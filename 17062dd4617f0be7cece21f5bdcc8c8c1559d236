      "message": "This is definitely better than what was there before, but I am still concerned about it.\n\nI\u0027m curious to hear Max\u0027s thoughts on this, but the way the method for getting the upload count was originally written as something that would be used relatively infrequently (only on the dashboard). If we need to expose this value more frequently, we should think about ways to cache this - and I\u0027m guessing that caching should occur on the frontend rather than the backend (eg do this one, store the value in LocalStorage, and update when an image is uploaded via mobile) or alternatively, to do it with memcache on the backend (and similarly update when an image gets uploaded).",

Doing this in memcache would work on the backend, but I\u0027m concerned about the value getting updated, though even with a low expiry time I think keeping it in memcache would be better than this, so that might be the easiest thing to do for now. There might be a MW hook that will help us get around this, but I dont know off the top of my head.\n\nOn a different note, pelase don\u0027t use the \u0027wg\u0027 prefix in the variable name. The \u0027wg\u0027 prefix is used for global config variables in MW, which this is not (I\u0027ve mentioned this elsewhere, but we should really update the other offending instances of this).",
