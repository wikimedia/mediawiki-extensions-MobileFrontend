      "message": "However, the hooks are only ever required in Node. Because of that, I\u0027m not sure that \"isomorphic\" is the correct mental model, because in the browser, these hooks are essentially noops.\n\nI think that\u0027s why I prefer the approach of adding the hooks to the config file directly, because that file is only ever executed by Node, whereas adding the hooks to the module definition implies that they do something in all contexts (at least IMO).",
