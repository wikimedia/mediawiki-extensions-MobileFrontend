There may be other things this resource needs to vary on that would get overwritten by this.\n\nAlso, maybe we should only add Vary: X-Device if the $xDevice is actually present- should this logic be moved into the if( $xDevice ) block?\n\nFurther, shouldn\u0027t this be checking $wgMFVaryResources before varying the resource on X-Device?",
