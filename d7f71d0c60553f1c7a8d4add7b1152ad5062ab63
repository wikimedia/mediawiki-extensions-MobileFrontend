      "message": "this line depends on the build, if you use vagrant you need to specify the `--wiki\u003dwiki` parameter. Also, not everyone has the core codebase in `~/git/core`, most probably it would be better to use `MW_INSTALL_PATH` variable.\n\nI think that we can keep the `make phpunit` as a way to run the PHPUnit unit tests, and then keep the all necessary logic inside the Makefile.\n\nI\u0027m a fan of this approach, having things like:\n  make phpunit (or even better - make test_php) to test the PHP\n  make qunit (or even better make test_js) to test the JS\n\nThe idea of having a Makefile in every repository as a basic toolset is very developer friendly. I don\u0027t need to know which tools do we use (phpunit/Codeception/Begat/PHPSpec for PHP, Jasmine/Mocha/Ava/Chai/Qunit) for JS. If I want to run tests, I just have to type `make tests` and hit enter, I don\u0027t have to worry what is the entry point for tests in every extension.\n\n\nTL;DR; I think it\u0027s valuable to keep it as it is, and allow people to use make to run tests.",
