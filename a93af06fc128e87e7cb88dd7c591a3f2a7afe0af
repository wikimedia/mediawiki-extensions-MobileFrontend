If that\u0027s the case, then I think splitting this out into if statements might be more readable. Maybe like this? (not sure but I think there\u0027s a precedence here, like try props first, then `this` right?)\n\n    var isBorderBox \u003d true;\n    if ( props.isBorderBox || this.isBorderBox ) {\n        isBorderBox \u003d props.isBorderBox || this.isBorderBox;\n    }",
