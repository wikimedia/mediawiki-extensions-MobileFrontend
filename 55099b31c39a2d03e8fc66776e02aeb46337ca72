If you think this is bloat we may can agree on removing it, but I would rather leave it in (there are also sighted users with keyboard only navigation, but I don\u0027t know whether they often use mobile sites, I doubt it).\n\nAbout changing h2 to a, I wanted to keep the changes here as small as possible. That change would require changing the server output, which would make a lot of things more complicated (different cached versions, ...)",
