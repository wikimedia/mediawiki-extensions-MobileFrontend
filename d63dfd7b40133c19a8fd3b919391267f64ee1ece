I kind of added it here as a first step just to offer control because displaying some sort of widget on the page itself would be a pretty big change, don\u0027t you think?\n\nFrom May\u0027s comment,\n\n\u003e I\u0027ve received feedback that the reading experience settings should stay under settings (accessible through side drawer) and I can agree because it isn\u0027t something users change frequently. Users will most likely adjust their reading experience settings (**text size**, contrast, background color) once every now and then to their comfortable spot.\n\n(My emphasis).
