Duplicated code maybe should be avoided somehow.\" I usually consider the duplication of code bad itself and tend do generalise code whenever possible, though I don\u0027t know how to do this here. What you mentioned would be an additional reason to do this generalisation.\n\nI don\u0027t think this is too complicated at all.

I\u0027d be happy for you to learn it!\n\nOne way we could generalise it is using a data attribute e.g. data-seconds data-minutes etc which points to the message key.\n\nWe could the run the last modified code on anything with a certain class (rather than id) to enhance it.\n\ne.g. timestamp-message-relative\n\nFeel free to write a follow up patch to explore this so that we can keep the generalization and the fix separate and make this work easier to follow.",
