      "message": "Avoid using .date() for the alt attribute as it can be user-controlled (it\u0027s user input) that is not meant to be parsed as a JavaScript value. jQuery is known to try and parse it as JSON. The src should be fine since it\u0027s system controlled and will always be a url. But redundant either way.",

      "message": "Unrelated and I\u0027m not a 100% sure, but you might want to experiment with using jQuery replaceWith() (or native replaceChild) so that we end up with a plain \u003cimg\u003e right where it would be otherwise. Looks like it\u0027s just the classname that needs transferring otherwise. That way you avoid any layout bugs or changes from having a span around the image, which does affect css selectors compatibility and things like layout calculation.",
