      "message": "Hmm.. I feel it would be a bit inconsistent as right now View is not a suffix for any View.\n\nWould that mean TalkOverlay became TalkOverlayView ?\n\nAlso, TalkBoard has model like behaviour (for the time being e.g. gateways)\n \nI think if we had pure View\u0027s that would make sense, but right now we don\u0027t so it could be misleading. Maybe something to consider further down the road?",

      "message": "Overlays are a special kind of View so calling a specific Overlay itself SpecificOverlayView would be redundant. I think their special distinctions from Views are:\n\n- They\u0027re only expected to be presented by the OverlayManager.\n- Historically, they\u0027ve been top level application user entry points like talk and edit, and are often associated with location changes.\n- In the past, they\u0027ve glued together multiple UI components and *supply whatever dependencies* the UI required like gateways or feature detection.\n- ...?\n\nThat isn\u0027t to say that Views haven\u0027t dipped into these responsibilities in (many) places but that\u0027s my interpretation of the intention. If there isn\u0027t a distinction, we certainly _should_ call Overlays Views.\n\nOn a related note, Page is a View, but it shouldn\u0027t be so I wouldn\u0027t call it PageView. (Although, I would split out a PageView from it. See T206335.)\n\nTalkBoard is the View injected into the TalkOverlay so it makes sense to me to call it TalkView, TalkBoardView, or even TalkOverlayView if we want to establish a pattern that each Overlay has a root View called FooOverlayView.",

      "message": "\u003e but for me, right now we are in a transitory state and the names should reflect their current state, not their ideal state.\n\nFor me, \"TalkBoard\" is a View first and a bag of other stuff second for a couple reasons:\n\n- It extends View.\n- Every Overlay has a View and were I working on TalkOverlay\u0027s UI, I would start by looking for Talk*View not Talk\u003cNewTerm\u003e. Even just knowing the user\u0027s UI entry point for non-View code is very useful.\n- Views are heavyweight and carry many view-only responsibilities despite any additional non-View code.\n\nFor these reasons, I would rather identify Views first and split off other stuff like Gateways as able later even if the naming was muddy in the interim.\n\n\u003e Longer term, I\u0027d also like us to think about these things as /components/ rather than /views/.\n\nI don\u0027t think I am getting the full benefit of this guidance as it\u0027s written. Can you clarify or reframe?\n\n\u003e Regardless I\u0027d prefer any name change to be done across the codebase rather than in this one particular patch. MessageBox for instance is not MessageBoxView in current form. Is a Drawer a DrawerView? If not, why? Is a Section a SectionView or something else?\n\nThis is true but all or nearly all Overlays are *Overlay. I would rather start calling things Views than ambiguous terms, especially new names.\n\nSectionView sounds good. DrawerView sounds fine too unless we have a very strong Drawer interface across multiple Views we want to distinguish with a new name.",
