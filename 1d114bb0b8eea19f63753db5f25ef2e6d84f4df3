The keys won\u0027t be used by PHPUnit, (the order will be), but it can help.\n\nE.g.:\n\n return [\n   [ \u0027shouldConfigChange\u0027 \u003d\u003e true, \u0027forceMobile\u0027 \u003d\u003e true, \u0027strip\u0027 \u003d\u003e true ],\n   ..\n ];\n\nIn addition, if there is use in having a descriptive name for a test case, you can also use keys in the main array. Those *are* used by PHPUnit in the test output. E.g. the below will result test failure for data set \"Support disabling all\" instead of \"data set #4 (false, false, false)\"\n\n return [\n  \u0027Support disabling all\u0027 \u003d\u003e [ false, false, false ]\n ];\n\nThis is probably not useful for this particular data provider, but thought I\u0027d add it here in case you didn\u0027t know about it yet :) Only recently learned of it myself.",
