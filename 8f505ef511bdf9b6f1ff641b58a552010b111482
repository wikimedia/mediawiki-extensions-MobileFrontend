This will however lead to less events to be logged by the editing schema which may cause alarm to the editing team if it\u0027s part of their KPIs.\n\nI do not feel comfortable merging this patch in current form without someone from the editing team Okaying this change.\n\nI would feel more comfortable if we retained the current behaviour of using `always` and doing this in a follow up.",
