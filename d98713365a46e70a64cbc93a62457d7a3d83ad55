      "message": "The main reason is that I wanted this diff to be as small as possible. I did not found it worth fixing this block here, as doing so would touch the same 4 lines anyway. In all other files only a few lines needed fixing.\n\nMy personal best-practice is to *not* have any @param when there is a @dataProvider. They tend to be vague and not helpful. For many @dataProviders the types would need to say \"mixed\".\n\nBut it\u0027s not the goal of this patch to introduce any kind of consistency, neither remove all @param on @dataProviders, nor add them.",
