      "message": "Again, this class is fairly simple. No need to alter its behaviour based on global state. If options.wikidataDescription is given, then use it, otherwise don\u0027t.\n\nI can\u0027t remember when/where it was said, but I\u0027m fairly sure that someone mentioned moving towards only using context in the init scripts. We should endeavour to make everything else agnostic â€“ this isn\u0027t a rule, it\u0027s a guideline.\n\nIf you really want to modify its behaviour, then why not subclass it like you\u0027ve done with SearchApi?",
