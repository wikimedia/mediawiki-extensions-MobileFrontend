      "message": "Good question! I also need to update my commit msg explaining my logic here. The reason why I removed that is because I looked in the .save method of EditorGateway and couldn\u0027t find a place where code and response were being set. When the promise rejects from EditorGateway, it looks like only one argument is being passed. Because of that, I think key will always be undefined. Additionally, if key is always undefined, then I don\u0027t think whitelistedErrorInfo has much use anymore in this code.\n\nTherefore, I removed the code paths below because I believe they were not ever being executed. Please let me know if I\u0027m wrong though.",
