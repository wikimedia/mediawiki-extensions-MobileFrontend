All this rule does is override that and do the opposite.\n\nWe could add an mw-ui-icon-flip in future if that is what you are talking about here - it would be a useful addition since we do this in 2 places now - but I\u0027m not sure how that is related to this change.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t agree that what we did previously was wrong for reasons I\u0027ve brought up previously.\n\nThis icon is the icon we use for toggling. Flipping that icon in ResourceLoaderImage module would be incorrect as now the arrows would point the wrong way for collapsed sections.\n\nAdding an additional icon to the css would bloat the CSS unnecessarily by introducing 4 new icons for all users (as I\u0027ve discussed previously - we\u0027d need 2 different colours). Icons are top loaded so this would have a detrimental effect on first paint.\n\nCSS transform support is pretty darn good. THis is why we use a transform to flip the toggle icon.\n\nLet\u0027s focus on the problem at hand - this icon doesn\u0027t render correctly in RTL mode. Let\u0027s fix this for users then if needed discuss reassessing the implementation, but I don\u0027t see a better way of implementing it.",

      "message": "What would happen if the chevron was slightly different from the toggle icon? Would you not include it as a separate icon, or would you say: \"This bloats CSS, thus we won\u0027t show this icon?\".\n\nYou\u0027re also assuming that these icons will evolve in sync. I think, right now, by pure chance, you can create the chevron by rotating the toggle icon, but if we had to make the toggle icon a little different, and keep the chevron as is, you\u0027d still have to create a new icon. So rather than postponing what is imminent, I suggest we do it the right way this time.\n\nThere is no need to load this icon at the top. The icon shows in the footer, thus it\u0027s OK to load it later. Nothing is forcing us to bundle these icons with the rest of the top icons.",
