      "message": "@Jdlrobson, well, IIRC, trailing commas are actually valid in ECMAScript 5. Setting `\"es3\": true` in the jshint config will warn you about this, but it\u0027ll also warn you about...well...any \"bad\" es3 you\u0027re using (which there definitely is in this repository).\n\nKrinkle recently helped me (and others, I think) get something get set up with jscs, a JavaScript *code style* checker. I don\u0027t know if the MobileFrontend team is interested in looking into that...but it does definitely have a `disallowTrailingComma` option :)\n\nSee also http://jshint.com/blog/jshint-3-plans/ and https://github.com/theopolisme/jquery-fullscreen/pull/9\n\nJust throwin\u0027 that out there.",
