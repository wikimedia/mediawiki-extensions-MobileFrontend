      "message": "Either class \u0027search\u0027 should be renamed, or a separate class should be created for this. Having a class name that doesn\u0027t match its scope will lead to bugs later on. I realize this line wasn\u0027t introduced in this change, but this seems like a good opportunity to fix it.\n\nAlso, if it were me, I would add an ID to this input so that it is clear what is being selected in the JS. $( \u0027input\u0027 ) is rather mysterious. This will also prevent unintentional breakage in the event that someone adds another input, such as a checkbox, to this interface. This is just a suggestion though.",
