The continuation values are considered opaque data by the API and may change in non-backwards-compatible ways without warning.\n\nNot going to -1 here since this is existing code, but we should probably look at what exactly this is trying to do and finding a better way to do it.",

I would have merged it myself only I wanted thoughts on this.",
