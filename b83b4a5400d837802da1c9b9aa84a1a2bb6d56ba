      "message": "This should be called before _getApiDataRaw is called and _getApiDataRaw should only be called if the hook didn\u0027t add any keys to apiQuery. Otherwise we have the risk that there are unused parameters left from _getApiDataRaw as we cannot override the complete array.\n\nFurthermore, the query should be passed to the hook as well because relying on the query being stored in the `pssearch` key doesn\u0027t seem to be a good idea.",

      "message": "I\u0027m fine with adding the query as a second parameter, but removing the query, which is used at the moment when the hook runs feels wrong. What, if another extension want to extend the query only?\n\nIf the query is passed as the second parameter, you can replace the whole array?!",
