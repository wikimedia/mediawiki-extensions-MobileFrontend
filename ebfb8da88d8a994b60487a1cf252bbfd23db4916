      "message": "Okay Jon, the reason why we can\u0027t just call $mbCollection-\u003egetPages() is because -\u003epages property is private and doing the binding exposes a way in which we can play around with the instance of the object and the property visibility. Also, see this: http://php.net/manual/en/closure.bind.php.\n\nIn addition, this method is far better and faster than ReflectionMethod. :)",
