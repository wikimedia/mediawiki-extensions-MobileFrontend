Have modules which list other modules as their dependencies, e.g.:\n\nmobile.beta.bundle \u003d\u003e depends on mobile.beta, mobile.search.beta, etc.\nmobile.stable.only.bundle \u003d\u003e depends on mobile.stable, mobile.lastEdited.stable, etc.\n\nThis way we wouldn\u0027t have to edit multiple files to sort out dependencies, everything would be in Resources.php.",
