      "message": "this looks ok, but i am not excited about this approach. it\u0027s an opaque way of defining resource modules - sacrificing readability for convenience. if you really want to do this, please document what\u0027s happening here/what\u0027s exacted better so i don\u0027t have to sit and read the processing code every time i a) review new modules b) am in the position where i want to add one :)",

      "message": "this method has gotten out of control. 100 lines is usually a sign that there is WAY too much going on in here, and it because increasingly difficult to read, understand, and test. i would prefer if this kind of stuff were broken out into separate methods, perhaps controlled by this attachResources() method. i don\u0027t want to block on this, however - we can always refactor later - but i figured i ought to flag this as a concern.",
