      "message": "mm.. I think that panel class name is misleading - it\u0027s not generated by the Panel class. We should have another look at those rules and decide if they make sense.\n\n\nThis is a separate bug and I think it should be thought about in a separate patch. Let\u0027s focus on the watchlist/history bug here.",
