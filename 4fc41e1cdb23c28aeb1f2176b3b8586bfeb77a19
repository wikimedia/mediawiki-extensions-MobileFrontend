I\u0027m coming from the standpoint that Cucumber is meant to document features as much as it\u0027s meant to run testsâ€”I know this isn\u0027t how we\u0027re utilizing it.\n\nMaybe we should get a third opinion here.",

      "message": "When this test was written, the \"progress bar\" appeared in Chrome but did not appear in FF, apparently because it only appears in browsers with particular capabilities. The MF team at the time would rather run the test in Chrome only than not test the progress bar at all.",

      "message": "Got it. In that case, I\u0027ll see if I can reimplement the step reliably for Chrome and remove the FF tag.\n\nSorry, Juliusz mentioned to me that FF support in MF tests isn\u0027t all that important because it doesn\u0027t represent most mobile browsers (oh, poor FF OS). That begs the question, why do we try to run MF BTs using FF at all?",
