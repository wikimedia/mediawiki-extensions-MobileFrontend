      "message": "I think we don\u0027t need to worry about a minimum of performance impact (as far as I know, both localStorage and Cookies have realtively the same speed). Especially because localStorage isn\u0027t supported by _all_ browsers (sure, most of them support it) and not in private browsing on mobile browsers [1] we should avoid to show the banner on every page load on every first link, which would be really annoying :) I think we should pay this little amount of performance for a well functioning website :)\n\n[1] http://caniuse.com/#search\u003dlocalstorage (see \"Known issues\")",
