      "message": "So we have MobileUI::iconClass to handle icons in php\n\nmw-ui-text doesn\u0027t exist to my knowledge. We do have mw-ui-anchor though.\n\nmw-ui-progressive is currently a modifier which needs the mw-ui-anchor\n\nWe might want to put something in MobileUI to abstract this to make it less easy to make mistakes and make it easier to move to OOJS UI",

Maybe I have to update core",
