      "message": "As I\u0027ve mentioned before the use of MobileContext inside Minerva is incorrect as i causes long term issues with pulling Minerva out of MobileFrontend and existing on it\u0027s own (consider a 3rd party who wants the Minerva skin but doesn\u0027t want to maintain a separate skin/mobile domain). \n\n\nYes.. I hear you.. we\u0027re not there yet... but this seems like a golden opportunity to rectify this rather than encourage this behaviour.\n\nWe already have a getDefaultMobileSkin method inside MobileFrontendHooks - could we pass an isBeta flag there as part of construction?\n\nIf we don\u0027t do that now.. when will be a better time to do it?",
