Actually if you write:\n\nAnd I type into search box \"Foo bar\"\n\nand run cucumber before implementing the step, Cucumber will generate a better snippet (it will assume that the part in quotes is an argument).",

      "message": "If that\u0027s the case, I would not test for the presence of the spinner at all. This still looks unreliable, who knows how 10.times (BTW, you don\u0027t need to assign it to a variable) will behave on different machines, how fast it will run on different Ruby interpreters, etc.\n\nI would just skip testing for the spinner. It\u0027s not that big of a deal, not crucial for the functionality (i.e. it\u0027s not the end of the world if the spinner is missing for a few days) and easy to catch by anyone simply using the page. Plus, the fact that it has a class \"spinner loading\" also doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s showing a spinner ;)\n\nLet\u0027s just check if the page gets loaded.",
