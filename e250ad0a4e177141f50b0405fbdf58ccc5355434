      "message": "this is what I mean by that method being confusingly named. You\u0027re functionally checking if the user is in beta, but the name implies that this special page \u0027requires beta mode\u0027. It may make more sense to set a property for this class (actually maybe all mobile special page classes) \u0027mode\u0027 or something (possible values are stable, beta, alpha) and in the execute() method always ensure that the correct special page is being shown to the user. This is funcitonality that we need on all special pages anyway, so may as well put it all in one place.",
